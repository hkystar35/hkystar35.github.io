I got my start in technology by pure happenstance and luck working for a small 200-person company that put me through my local state college for Computer Networking. After taking, and somehow passing, my CCNA classes, it became clear to me that not only did I struggle to fully understand BGP, OSPF, or collision domains, I could barely configure a router. So I opted to hang out in the Help Desk space and eventually ended up as an Endpoint Engineer.

Without too much detail, I worked several years on a DoD contract, moving from inbound calls to on-site support, then to a civil engineering company where I transitioned into endpoint management/engineering. After that, I actively sought orgs with smaller environments. That served well for a few years, but now I'm back in a large organization and am a full-time Apple/Mac engineer.

I have no real expectations for this site other than to be a sounding board of my own misadventures in IT. Enjoy, if only for laughs.
